# RoN_Blender_to_Maya
This is a tool I have developed to use your existing version of Blender and port over the `.psk` files into Maya.

It imports the psk into blender using a batch process and sets the scale correctly before exporting as an fbx to your designated location.
You then have the option of importing it and allowing it to automatically be cleaned by the tool, or manually importing it, OR setting the `fix_fbx` argument to `False.
